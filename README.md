## Project Status

* ~~Brainstorming for datasets phase: Currently collecting ideas for dataset collection for lyrics and MIDI data. See the Issues page for details.~~
* ~~Collecting actual data for lyrics and MIDI.~~
* ~~Decide and implement pre-processing scheme for data (specifically for MIDI).~~
* Release training script and model API code.

* Please begin by reading papers from the [Reading List](https://github.com/AI-ON/Few-Shot-Music-Generation/blob/master/READING_LIST.md) to familiarize yourself with work in this area.

### Data

Both the lyrics and freemidi data can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1sI1K3CjzpN81QjjpaEDVKW79c7AOUdyQ). Place the `raw-data` directory in the home folder of the repository and make sure to unzip both `.zip` files in the data sub-directories.

For example, for the lyrics data, make sure in the given path the following files and directories exist:
```
ls Few-Shot-Music-Generation/raw-data/lyrics/
>> lyrics_data test.csv  train.csv  val.csv
```

### Training Models
Sample run (check the different yaml files for different ways to run):
```
$ CONFIG=lyrics.yaml
$ MODEL=lstm_baseline.yaml
$ TASK=5shot.yaml
python -um train.train --data=config/${CONFIG} --model=config/${MODEL} --task=config/${TASK} --checkpt_dir=/tmp/fewshot/lstm_baseline
```

To view the tensorboard (only works for `lstm_baseline.yaml` model):
```
$ tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/fewshot

If you have any trouble running the code, please create an issue describing your problem.
